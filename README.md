# AutoAttack

A script that lets you hold down ``spacebar`` to simulate repeated mouse clicks.

I wrote this for playing ARPG games that are very clicky, saving me from developing carpal tunnel syndrome.  I'm currently using this to play Diablo II Resurrected, but it requires that I type the ``/nopickup`` command to avoid picking up all the items on the ground.

## For PC

This is really great.

### Original

- Install [AutoHotKey](http://autohotkey.com/).
- Download the [AutoAttack](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/whipowill/ahk-autoattack/master/AutoAttack.ahk) script.
- Right click and select "Run As Administrator".
- Hit ``capslock`` to toggle the script on/off.
- Hold ``spacebar`` to move and attack.

### Advanced

- Install [AutoHotKey](http://autohotkey.com/).
- Download the [AutoAttackAdvanced](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/whipowill/ahk-autoattack/master/AutoAttackAdvanced.ahk) script.
- Right click and select "Run As Administrator".
- Only works in Diablo II (so it won't interere with other apps).
- Hit ``capslock`` to toggle the script on/off.
- Hit ``numlock`` to toggle Whirlwind mode (will hold ALT while using Whirlwind).
- Hit ``enter`` to disable the script (automatic chat detection).
- Hold ``spacebar`` to move and attack.

## For Mac

This isn't as good as PC, but it's the best I could do.

- Install [Keyboard Maestro](https://www.keyboardmaestro.com/main/).
- Download the KMMacros [script](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/whipowill/ahk-autoattack/master/AutoAttack.kmmacros).
- Import the script into Keyboard Maestro.
- Hit ``control-d`` to toggle the script on/off.
- Hold ``spacebar`` to move and attack.

## For Linux

This is in development and has problems.
